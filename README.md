# Active Directory Offensive Security

Welcome to the Active Directory Attacking section of my pentesting writeups. 

Here, you'll find detailed guides, methodologies, and tools that I've used for performing attacks on Active Directory (AD) environments. 

This directory is dedicated to sharing knowledge, techniques, and experiences related to Active Directory security testing. 
## GOAD Environment with LUDEUS

**[GOAD (Greedy Offensive Active Directory)](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD)** is a lab environment specifically designed for practicing Active Directory attacks. 

There are different types of GOAD labs. I have worked on the full GOAD lab, which has a total of 5 vms, 2 forests and 3 domains.

Here's what you can find:

- By now there are writeups on attacking Active Directory using Game of Active Directory (GOAD) which is installed on Ludus.
  - [**LUDUS Tool:**](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/intro/)

This document is a structured walkthrough of the GOAD (Game of Active Directory) lab. It follows a typical red team kill chain approach:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Initial Access
3. Credential Access
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Golden Ticket
6. ADCS and Delegation
7. Bonus - Sliver
